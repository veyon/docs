Access control rules
====================

Introduction
------------

Access control rules can be used to provide detailed control over which users can access specific computers under specific circumstances. In the following, the term *rule* is used as a synonym for *access control rule*.

When a user attempts to access a computer, the defined access control rules are processed one after another until all conditions of a rule apply. As soon as all activated conditions of a rule apply, no further rules are processed and the stored action is executed (exception: rule is disabled).

The rules can be configured through the Veyon Configurator on the configuration page :ref:`ConfAccessControl` in section :guilabel:`Access control rules`. The rules list is empty by default. In this case, all access attempts are denied since there is no rule that explicitly allows access. This means that at least one rule must be defined that allows access under certain conditions.

Add and modify rules
----------------------

Upon clicking the button :guilabel:`+` a dialog opens which allows the creation of a new rule. Existing rules can be opened or edited by double-clicking them or by clicking the button with the pen symbol.

A rule basically consists of general settings, conditions and an action that is executed when all conditions apply. The dialog is divided into three sections. The meanings of the individual options in the various dialog sections are explained below.

General
+++++++

.. index:: Fallback access rule

A name for the rule should be defined in input field :guilabel:`Rule name` first. The name is later used to identify the rule and is displayed in the rules list. For documentation purposes an optional description can be added to the :guilabel:`Rule description` input field.

The option :guilabel:`Always process rule and ignore conditions` causes the conditions set below not to be examined for rule processing and the set action is always executed. This particularly useful for fallback rules at the bottom of the rules list, where you can specify that the logged on user is asked for permission if no other rules apply.

You can use the :guilabel:`Invert all conditions` option to determine that all activated conditions are inverted before evaluation, meaning that activated conditions must not apply. For example, if the condition *No user logged on* is activated, the rule only applies if one or more users are logged on. If a condition is configured so that a user must be a member of a specific group, the rule only applies, if the said user is *not* a member of the group.


Conditions
++++++++++

.. index:: Access control rule condition

For a rule to be processed, one or more conditions must apply.

User is member of group
    You can use this condition to specify that either the accessing or the locally logged in user must be a member of a specific group. The desired group can be selected. If no or only wrong groups are selectable, the *User groups backend* under the general settings for :ref:`ComputerAccessControl` may have to be adjusted. Alternatively, a regular expression can be entered to control access from or to certain groups whose names match a certain pattern, e.g. ``/Class 20\d\d-\d\d/`` for the class groups 20NN-NN.

Computer is located at
    With this condition you can define that either the accessing or the local computer has to be located at a specific location. The desired location can be selected. If no or only wrong locations are selectable the :ref:`RefNetworkObjectDirectory` has to be adjusted. Alternatively, a regular expression can be entered to control access from or to multiple locations whose names match a certain pattern.

Accessing computer and local computer are at the same location
    You can use this condition to specify that the accessing computer and the local computer must be in the same location. This can be used, for example, to prevent teachers from accessing computers outside their own classroom.

.. _AccessingComputerIsLocalhost:

Accessing computer is localhost
    If this condition is enabled, the rule applies only if the accessing computer is the local computer. This ensures for example that teachers can access the local Veyon Service. This access is necessary for the Veyon Master to execute specific functions via the Veyon Service (e.g. the server for demo mode).

Accessing user has one or more groups in common with local (logged on) user
    You can use this condition to specify that the accessing and the local user have to be members of at least one common group, for example a user group for a class or a seminar.

Accessing user is logged on user
    As an alternative to the condition *accessing computer is localhost* you can also allow a user to access his own sessions. This condition must be activated for this purpose.

Accessing user is already connected
    In conjunction with the condition *Accessing computer and local computer are at the same location* an extended ruleset can be created allowing access to computer at other locations under certain conditions. This includes the possibility to access a computer if the accessing user is already connected. For example, if the teacher logs on to a teacher computer in room A and B simultaneously and displays the computers of room B displayed in Veyon Master, the computers in room B have a connection from the teacher. Then the teacher can also access room B from Veyon Master in room A if this condition is activated with an allow action.

No user logged on
    This condition determines how a computer can be accessed when no user is logged on. For easier computer administration, it can be helpful to always be able to access a computer when no user is logged on.

Local computer is already being accessed
    If this condition is activated, the rule takes effect if there is already at least one connection to the local Veyon Service. This can be used, for example, to prevent parallel access to a computer.

Action
++++++

.. index:: Access control rule action

If all the enabled conditions of a rule apply, a specific action is performed with respect to computer access. You can define this action in section :guilabel:`Action`:

.. index:: Allow access

Allow access
    Access to a computer is allowed and further rules are not processed. If there is a rule in the rules list below that would deny access, access is still allowed. There must be at least one rule with this action.

.. index:: Deny access

Deny access
    Access to a computer is denied and further rules are not processed. If there is a rule in the rules list below that would allow access, access is still denied.

.. index:: Ask logged on user for permission

Ask logged on user for permission
    This action displays a dialog on the computer that allows the logged-in user to choose whether to allow or deny access. No further rules are processed regardless of the user's decision.

None (rule disabled)
    This action makes the rule being ignore. Access control will be continued by processing the next rule. This option can be used to create an inactive dummy entry to visually subdivide the rules list.

By clicking the :guilabel:`OK` button the rule and the changes made are accepted and the dialog is closed.


Sorting rules
-------------

.. important:: The defined access control rules are processed one after the other in the order of the list. The action of the first matching rule is executed, even if subsequent rules would also apply and lead to a different action.

All rules can be reordered via the buttons with the arrow symbols. Rules that should fundamentally prevent or allow access based on certain criteria should be placed as high up as possible. Rules to cover special cases can follow below. Rules for the implementation of fallback behaviour should be at the bottom.

Logical concatenation of rules
------------------------------

.. index:: Negation operator, Inverse rule, Inverse condition

If more than one condition is activated in a rule, *each* condition must apply for the rule to be applied (logical AND). If only one of several rules should apply (logical OR), several access control rules must be defined.

With basic knowledge of Boolean algebra, the option *Invert all conditions* can be used as negation operator in conjunction with inverted actions to model extended scenarios. For example, if a user must be a member of two specific groups to allow access to a computer, two separate rules can be created that deny access, if the user is *not* a member of either group.

.. note:: If there is no matching access control rule so that all activated conditions apply, access is denied and the connection is closed. This prevents an attacker from being accidentally allowed access due to an incomplete ruleset.


Testing a ruleset
-----------------

In section :guilabel:`Computer access control` the configured ruleset can be checked with various scenarios using the :guilabel:`Test` button. In the test dialog you can enter the parameters to simulate a scenario. With the button :guilabel:`OK` the rules are processed with the given parameters and a message with the test result is displayed.
