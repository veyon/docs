msgid "FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions"
msgstr "FAQ - 常見問答集"

msgid "Can other users see my screen?"
msgstr "其他使用者能否看到我的螢幕?"

msgid ""
"Which user can access which computer under which circumstances depends on "
"the system settings configured by your administrator. Usually the software "
"is configured so that the course instructor can access the computers of "
"course participants, but not vice versa. Whether other course instructors "
"are able to see your screen or those of other course participants also "
"depends on the settings. Contact your administrator in order to configure "
"access control rules according to your needs as described in the "
"administration manual."
msgstr ""

msgid "How frequently are the computer thumbnails updated?"
msgstr "更新電腦縮圖的頻率?"

msgid ""
"Usually the computer thumbnails in the monitoring view are updated once a "
"second. Depending on the utilization of the network and the computer, there "
"may be slight deviations. In contrast when remote controlling or viewing a "
"computer, you see the screen content of the remote computer in real time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What happens if I accidentally close the Veyon Master application window?"
msgstr "如果我不小心關閉了 Veyon Master 應用程式視窗，會發生什麼情況?"

msgid ""
"Any active functions such as demo mode or screen lock are stopped when the "
"program is closed. However, you can simply reopen the program and activate "
"the mode again if necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "How can I broadcast the screen of a student to all other screens?"
msgstr "如何將學生的螢幕廣播到所有其他螢幕?"

msgid ""
"If you want to transfer a student's screen instead of your own screen in "
"demo mode, first activate demo mode for all computers. Then stop demo mode "
"for the student to be performing the demo using the context menu. Finally "
"open the remote view for the students computer. This will transfer the "
"remote view window - and therefore the student's screen - to all other "
"computers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Program features"
msgstr "程式功能"

msgid ""
"Veyon offers a variety of features that let you control and access "
"computers. All available features are accessible through the buttons in the "
"toolbar as well as the context menu of individual computers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you move the mouse over the individual buttons in the toolbar, a tooltip "
"with a short help text is displayed unless you have disabled tooltips. "
"Pressing a button activates the desired feature on all displayed computers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using functions on individual computers"
msgstr "在單獨電腦上使用功能"

msgid ""
"If you only want to activate a function on a single computer, right-click "
"the computer in the monitor view and select the desired function from the "
"context menu. The entries in the context menu are displayed dynamically "
"depending on the active functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also select multiple computers in the monitor view by drawing a "
"selection rectangle with the mouse that includes all desired computers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can press the :kbd:`Ctrl` key and add computers "
"individually to the selection via mouse click."
msgstr ""

msgid "Monitoring mode"
msgstr "監視模式"

msgid ""
"By default Veyon is running in monitoring mode. In this mode you have an "
"overview of all computers and see their screen contents in thumbnails. The "
"screen content is updated almost in real time, so you can monitor all "
"activity at the selected locations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As long as there is no connection to a computer, a computer icon is "
"displayed instead of the screen content. After the program has been started,"
" the icon is initially colored gray. As soon as the program detects that the"
" computer is unreachable or access is denied, the color changes to red."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of the features described in the next sections switch the remote "
"computers to a different mode. You can exit the respective mode by "
"activating monitoring mode again."
msgstr "下一節中描述的一些功能將遠端電腦切換到其它模式。 您可以透過再次啟動監視模式來結束相應的模式。"

msgid "Demonstration mode"
msgstr "示範模式"

msgid ""
"You can use the demonstration mode (demo mode) to start a presentation. In "
"this mode, the content of your or a student's screen is broadcasted to all "
"computers and displayed in real time. You can choose between a full screen "
"and a window demo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During a full screen demo your screen content will be displayed in full "
"screen on the remote computers. Logged-in users cannot use their computers "
"for other tasks in this mode because all input devices are locked. In this "
"way you will gain the full attention of your students."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By contrast, a window demo allows users to switch between the demo window "
"and their own applications. For example, course participants can arrange the"
" windows side by side and try out the demonstrated steps themselves in "
"parallel. The input devices are therefore not locked in this mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to start a demonstration, you have to open the demo menu by "
"pressing the :guilabel:`Demo`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now click the desired item in the menu. If you want to share a student's "
"screen, make sure to select it before so the program knows which screen to "
"broadcast."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case your computer is equipped with multiple screens, you can choose to "
"only broadcast one of the screens. To do this, click the corresponding "
"screen item in the demo menu before sharing your screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to leave the demonstration mode again, simply press the button "
"again or click on the :guilabel:`Monitoring` button to switch back to "
"monitoring mode globally. The context menu can also be used to stop the "
"demonstration mode on individual computers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lock screens"
msgstr "鎖定螢幕"

msgid ""
"Another way to draw students' attention is to use the screen lock feature. "
"As during a full-screen demonstration, all input devices on the students' "
"computers are locked. The computers can then no longer be used by the "
"students. In addition, a lock symbol is displayed to prevent distractions "
"caused by open applications."
msgstr ""

msgid "Press the :guilabel:`Lock` button to lock all displayed computers:"
msgstr "按下 :guilabel:`鎖定` 按鈕鎖定所有顯示的電腦"

msgid ""
"If you want to unlock the screens, simply press the button again or click "
"the :guilabel:`Monitoring` button to switch back to monitoring mode "
"globally."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If only individual computers are to be locked, you can select them as "
"described in section :ref:`NonGlobalFeatureActivation` and select the screen"
" lock feature in the context menu. The screen lock can then be deactivated "
"either by selecting :guilabel:`Unlock` or switching back to "
":guilabel:`Monitoring` mode. The screen lock can also be activated globally "
"at first and later deactivated for individual computers via the context "
"menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to security restrictions of most operating systems, the lock screen can "
"not be displayed if no user is logged on. The input devices are still "
"locked, so that no user logon is possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remote access"
msgstr "遠端存取"

msgid ""
"The feature group *remote access* consists of two very similar features "
":guilabel:`Remote view` and :guilabel:`Remote control`. In both access "
"modes, the screen of a remote computer is displayed in full size in a "
"separate window. In contrast to the monitoring mode in the main window, you "
"can watch the activities on a computer in detail or intervene yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The features can be activated in different ways. Depending on the system "
"configuration, one of the two features is usually started by double-clicking"
" on a computer. Alternatively, you can click the right mouse button to open "
"the context menu and select the desired feature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to access a computer that does not appear in the monitor view, "
"use the corresponding toolbar button:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After pressing this button, a dialog is opened and asks for the hostname of "
"the computer to access:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Afterwards a new window opens with the remote access view:"
msgstr "之後，開啟一個含有遠端存取檢視的新視窗:"

msgid ""
"The remote screen is then displayed within a few seconds and updated in real"
" time. At the top of the window you will see a toolbar with buttons similar "
"to the main application. The toolbar disappears automatically a few seconds "
"after the connection is established. You can show it again at any time by "
"moving the mouse pointer to the top of the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also change the access mode at any time during a running remote "
"access session. All you need to do is click on the :guilabel:`Remote "
"control` or :guilabel:`View only` button. The button does not show the "
"current access mode, but the access mode that is changed when pressed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As soon as you have entered the :guilabel:`Remote control` mode, your "
"keystrokes, mouse movements and clicks are transmitted to the remote "
"computer so that you can operate it as usual. However, depending on the "
"operating system, certain special keys or key shortcuts such as "
":kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+Del` cannot be used directly. If you want to use these "
"shortcuts, you can use the button :guilabel:`Send shortcut`.  Clicking this "
"button opens a menu where you can select the desired shortcut:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the menu was opened accidentally, it can also be closed again without "
"triggering an action by clicking the button again or pressing the :kbd:`Esc`"
" key."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to switch to fullscreen mode, you can use the "
":guilabel:`Fullscreen` button. In full screen mode, the button label changes"
" to :guilabel:`Window`. You can easily switch back to window mode by "
"clicking on it again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Screenshot` function captures the current screen content and "
"saves it to a file that can be displayed later. More information regarding "
"screenshots can be found in sections :ref:`Screenshots panel "
"<ScreenshotsPanel>` and :ref:`Screenshots <FeatureScreenshot>`."

msgid "Power on, restart and shutdown computers"
msgstr "開啟電源、重新開機和關閉電腦"

msgid ""
"The features :guilabel:`Power on`, :guilabel:`Reboot` and :guilabel:`Power "
"down` are helpful both for administrative purposes and for the preparation "
"and follow-up of courses and exams. Using these functions, you can remotely "
"power on, restart, or shut down computers. The corresponding buttons can be "
"found in the toolbar:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the appropriate button to power on, restart, or shut down all "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on the configuration of the network and the system settings of the"
