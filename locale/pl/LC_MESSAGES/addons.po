"Filters make it possible to read out only certain objects (devices, users "

"required for Veyon. If, for example, security groups are used as locations "
"(rooms), the :guilabel:`Device groups filter` can be adjusted accordingly so"
" that only groups starting with ``Room`` are used as locations. In that case"

msgid ""
"If all device names match the hostnames and can be resolved to IP addresses "
"using an internal DNS server (BIND, AD DS etc.) you can keep the default "

"(extension) attribute and enter the name of this attribute in the "
":guilabel:`MAC address attribute` field. If your devices are managed via "
"Microsoft Intune you can also change the setting to use the Ethernet or Wi-"
"Fi MAC addresses stored in Intune. Depending on the selected option, only "

msgid ""
"Select this mode if your devices belong to (security) groups which "
"correspond to locations. This is the most preferred way since in Entra ID "
"it's quite easy to create groups for each room and add the devices to the "
"corresponding groups. Most likely you will have to configure a suitable "
":guilabel:`Device groups filter` in the :guilabel:`Filters` section such "
"that only these groups (e.g. starting with name ``Room``) are displayed as "
"locations. Optionally you can configure the name of the group attribute "

msgstr ""

msgid "Use location attribute of device"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an alternative to location-based groups, the location of each computer "

"this attribute must be specified."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extract from hostname via regular expression"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the hostnames contain the room or location name, you can let Entra ID "
"Connector extract the location name. This is done by applying a regular "
"expression on the hostnames. The first capture group of the regular "
"expression is then used as location / computer name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if the hostnames have the format ``r<ROOM-NUMBER>-c<COMPUTER-"
"NUMBER>`` (e.g. ``r101-c01.example.org``), you can use the following regular"
" expression to extract the location name:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``([^-]*)-.*``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first capture (in braces) captures everything until the first minus "

"specyficzne dla platformy:"

msgid "Windows"
msgstr "Windows"

msgid ""
"Veyon controls the integrated Windows firewall and makes temporary changes "

msgstr ""
"Aplikacja Veyon kontroluje zintegrowaną zaporę systemu Windows i wprowadza "

"nie mogą być blokowane przez zasady grupy."

msgid "Linux"
msgstr "Linux"

msgid ""
"Veyon works on the basis of *nftables* and calls the related command line "
"tool ``nft``. This is used to temporarily add additional rules to block "
"Internet access."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For both operating systems, the backend configuration is identical. In "
"general different modes are available. The mode selection depends on the "
"network environment and the desired blocking behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "Block all outbound traffic for TCP and UDP ports"
msgstr "Blokowanie całego ruchu wychodzącego dla portów TCP i UDP"

msgid ""
"This is the default mode and should work in most environments. In this mode "
"the Veyon Service adds special rules to the firewall which block any traffic"
" to the configured ports. Use this mode if blocking the TCP and UDP ports "
"80/443 and one or multiple custom ports (separated by space) is sufficient. "
"To block all traffic use the second mode."
msgstr ""

msgid "Block all outbound traffic to non-local subnets"
msgstr "Zablokuj cały ruch wychodzący do nielokalnych podsieci"

msgid ""
"In this mode, all network traffic directed to networks outside the local "
"subnets is blocked. On Windows, the Veyon service temporarily changes the "
"configuration of all firewall profiles (domain, private, public) to “ "
"Outbound connections that do not match a rule are blocked”. If "
":guilabel:`Exceptions` are configured, appropriate rules are added to allow "
"access to these networks, hosts or ports. This can be used, for example, to "
"preserve access to the intranet and other internally hosted platforms. "
"External websites can also be defined as exceptions here under certain "
"circumstances, but the addresses of all servers/CDNs from which the website "
"loads resources must then also be specified."
msgstr ""

msgid "Block traffic to (e.g. proxy or DNS) servers"
msgstr "Zablokuj ruch do serwerów (np. proxy lub DNS)"

msgid ""
"If the student computers access the Internet via a proxy server, you can "
"select this option. A firewall rule is then added that simply blocks all "
"traffic to the proxy address. Alternatively, access to certain DNS servers "
"can also be blocked, although in most cases this leads to problems when "
"accessing internal resources such as network drives etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable preconfigured firewall rule"
msgstr "Włącz wstępnie skonfigurowane reguły zapory sieciowej"

msgid ""
"If the three modes above are not suitable for your network you can also "
"configure an own custom rule in the Windows Firewall. This rule should be "
"disabled by default. The Veyon Service will enable this rule while the "
"Internet access is to be blocked. On Linux the Veyon Service calls ``nft`` "
"to load the nftables rules from the file "
"``/etc/veyon/iac/firewall/rules.d/<RULENAME>``. You can define any nftables "
"rules in this file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Block internet access by modifying routing table"
msgstr "Zablokuj dostęp do Internetu, modyfikując tabelę routingu"

msgid ""
"If the firewall backend cannot be used (e.g. if a 3rdparty firewall software"
" is used instead of the Windows Firewall), you can use this backend as a "
"fallback. It works in a very simple way by temporarily removing the default "
"route from the routing table and/or adding a user-defined (possibly "
"deliberately invalid) route to block Internet access. In any case, the "
"settings should be made carefully so that access to the internal network "
"continues to function properly. Especially in larger segmented networks, "
"both options should be combined by removing the default route on the one "
"hand and adding a route to the internal network on the other."
msgstr ""
"Jeśli backend zapory nie może być użyty (np. jeśli zamiast Zapory systemu "
"Windows używane jest oprogramowanie zapory innej firmy), można użyć tego "
"backendu jako rozwiązania awaryjnego. Działa to w bardzo prosty sposób, "
"tymczasowo usuwając domyślną trasę z tablicy routingu i/lub dodając "
"zdefiniowaną przez użytkownika (być może celowo nieprawidłową) trasę w celu "
"zablokowania dostępu do Internetu. W każdym przypadku ustawienia powinny być"
" dokonywane ostrożnie, aby dostęp do sieci wewnętrznej nadal działał "
