msgid "FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions"
msgstr "常见问答"

msgid "Can other users see my screen?"
msgstr "其他用户是否能看到我的屏幕？"

msgid ""
"Which user can access which computer under which circumstances depends on "
"the system settings configured by your administrator. Usually the software "
"is configured so that the course instructor can access the computers of "
"course participants, but not vice versa. Whether other course instructors "
"are able to see your screen or those of other course participants also "
"depends on the settings. Contact your administrator in order to configure "
"access control rules according to your needs as described in the "
"administration manual."
msgstr ""
"哪个用户在哪个环境下能访问哪台计算机取决于您的管理员所做的系统配置。通常软件被设置为课程讲师可以访问课程参加者的计算机，而不是相反。其他课程讲师是否能看到您或其他课程参加者的屏幕也取决于配置。请联系您的管理员参照管理手册，根据您的需要配置访问控制规则。"

msgid "How frequently are the computer thumbnails updated?"
msgstr "计算机缩略图多长时间更新一次？"

msgid ""
"Usually the computer thumbnails in the monitoring view are updated once a "
"second. Depending on the utilization of the network and the computer, there "
"may be slight deviations. In contrast when remote controlling or viewing a "
"computer, you see the screen content of the remote computer in real time."
msgstr ""
"通常监控视图里的缩略图每秒钟更新一次。根据计算机和网络的使用情况，可能会有一些偏差。相比之下，在远程控制或查看计算机时，您看到的是远程计算机的实时屏幕内容。"

msgid ""
"What happens if I accidentally close the Veyon Master application window?"
msgstr "当我不小心关闭了Veyon主程序窗口时会发生什么？"

msgid ""
"Any active functions such as demo mode or screen lock are stopped when the "
"program is closed. However, you can simply reopen the program and activate "
"the mode again if necessary."
msgstr "当程序关闭时，任何正在使用的功能如演示模式或屏幕锁将会停止。但必要时您可以重新打开程序并再次激活相应模式。"

msgid "How can I broadcast the screen of a student to all other screens?"
msgstr "我怎么将一个学生的屏幕广播到所有其他屏幕上？"

msgid ""
"If you want to transfer a student's screen instead of your own screen in "
"demo mode, first activate demo mode for all computers. Then stop demo mode "
"for the student to be performing the demo using the context menu. Finally "
"open the remote view for the students computer. This will transfer the "
"remote view window - and therefore the student's screen - to all other "
"computers."
msgstr ""
"如果您想在演示模式中传输一个学生而不是您自己的屏幕，首先需要为所有计算机激活演示模式。然后使用上下文菜单把将要进行演示的学生的演示模式停止。最后打开这个学生计算机的远程视图。这样就会将远程视图窗口——也就是学生的屏幕——传输到所有其他计算机。"

msgid "Program features"
msgstr "程序特性"

msgid ""
"Veyon offers a variety of features that let you control and access "
"computers. All available features are accessible through the buttons in the "
"toolbar as well as the context menu of individual computers."
msgstr "Veyon提供了一系列特性以帮助您控制和访问计算机。所有可用特性都可以通过工具栏里的按钮或者个人计算机的上下文菜单来访问。"

msgid ""
"If you move the mouse over the individual buttons in the toolbar, a tooltip "
"with a short help text is displayed unless you have disabled tooltips. "
"Pressing a button activates the desired feature on all displayed computers."
msgstr ""
"当您将鼠标划过工具栏中的单个按钮时，一个带有简短帮助文本的工具提示将会显示，除非您禁用了工具提示。按下按钮将在所有显示的计算机上激活您想要的功能。"

msgid "Using functions on individual computers"
msgstr "在个人计算机上使用功能"

msgid ""
"If you only want to activate a function on a single computer, right-click "
"the computer in the monitor view and select the desired function from the "
"context menu. The entries in the context menu are displayed dynamically "
"depending on the active functions."
msgstr "如果您只想在单个计算机上激活功能，右击监控视图中的计算机并从上下文菜单中选择想要的功能。上下文菜单的条目将根据活动的功能动态显示。"

msgid ""
"You can also select multiple computers in the monitor view by drawing a "
"selection rectangle with the mouse that includes all desired computers:"
msgstr "您也可以使用鼠标画出矩形选择框来选定您想要的多台计算机。"

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can press the :kbd:`Ctrl` key and add computers "
"individually to the selection via mouse click."
msgstr "或者，您可以按下 :kbd:`Ctrl` 键然后使用鼠标点击来逐个选择多台计算机。"

msgid "Monitoring mode"
msgstr "监控模式"

msgid ""
"By default Veyon is running in monitoring mode. In this mode you have an "
"overview of all computers and see their screen contents in thumbnails. The "
"screen content is updated almost in real time, so you can monitor all "
"activity at the selected locations."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下Veyon运行在监控模式下。在此模式中您可以看到所有计算机的概览并通过缩略图查看它们的屏幕内容。屏幕内容会近实时更新，所以您可以监控选择地点的所有活动。"

msgid ""
"As long as there is no connection to a computer, a computer icon is "
"displayed instead of the screen content. After the program has been started,"
" the icon is initially colored gray. As soon as the program detects that the"
" computer is unreachable or access is denied, the icon changes accordingly "
"and a status message is shown in the tooltip of the computer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of the features described in the next sections switch the remote "
"computers to a different mode. You can exit the respective mode by "
"activating monitoring mode again."
msgstr "在下一节中介绍的一些功能特性会将远程计算机切换到不同的模式。您可以通过重新激活监控模式来退出那些模式。"

msgid "Demonstration mode"
msgstr "演示模式"

msgid ""
"You can use the demonstration mode (demo mode) to start a presentation. In "
"this mode, the content of your or a student's screen is broadcasted to all "
"computers and displayed in real time. You can choose between a full screen "
"and a window demo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During a full screen demo your screen content will be displayed in full "
"screen on the remote computers. Logged-in users cannot use their computers "
"for other tasks in this mode because all input devices are locked. In this "
"way you will gain the full attention of your students."
msgstr ""
"在全屏演示期间，您的屏幕内容将在远程计算机上全屏显示。 在此模式下，已登录的用户无法将其计算机用于其他任务，因为所有输入设备均被锁定。 "
"这样，您将获得学生的全部关注。"

msgid ""
"By contrast, a window demo allows users to switch between the demo window "
"and their own applications. For example, course participants can arrange the"
" windows side by side and try out the demonstrated steps themselves in "
"parallel. The input devices are therefore not locked in this mode."
msgstr ""
"相比之下，窗口演示允许用户在演示窗口和自己的应用程序之间切换。 例如，课程参与者可以并排布置窗户，并亲自尝试演示的步骤。 "
"因此，输入设备未锁定在此模式下。"

msgid ""
"In order to start a demonstration, you have to open the demo menu by "
"pressing the :guilabel:`Demo`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now click the desired item in the menu. If you want to share a student's "
"screen, make sure to select it before so the program knows which screen to "
"broadcast."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case your computer is equipped with multiple screens, you can choose to "
"only broadcast one of the screens. To do this, click the corresponding "
"screen item in the demo menu before sharing your screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to leave the demonstration mode again, simply press the button "
"again or click on the :guilabel:`Monitoring` button to switch back to "
"monitoring mode globally. The context menu can also be used to stop the "
"demonstration mode on individual computers."
msgstr ""
"如果您想再次退出演示模式，只需再次按下按钮或单击 :guilabel:`监视` 按钮即可全局切换回监视模式。 "
"上下文菜单还可以用于停止单台计算机上的演示模式。"

msgid "Lock screens"
msgstr "锁定屏幕"

msgid ""
"Another way to draw students' attention is to use the screen lock feature. "
"As during a full-screen demonstration, all input devices on the students' "
"computers are locked. The computers can then no longer be used by the "
"students. In addition, a lock symbol is displayed to prevent distractions "
"caused by open applications."
msgstr ""
"引起学生注意的另一种方法是使用屏幕锁定功能。 与全屏演示过程一样，学生计算机上的所有输入设备均被锁定。 这样，学生将无法再使用计算机。 "
"此外，还会显示一个锁定符号，以防止因打开的应用程序而引起的干扰。"

msgid "Press the :guilabel:`Lock` button to lock all displayed computers:"
msgstr "按 :guilabel:`锁定`按钮锁定所有显示的计算机:"

msgid ""
"If you want to unlock the screens, simply press the button again or click "
"the :guilabel:`Monitoring` button to switch back to monitoring mode "
"globally."
msgstr "如果您想再次退出演示模式，只需再次按下按钮或单击 :guilabel:`监视` 按钮即可全局切换回监视模式。 "

msgid ""
"If only individual computers are to be locked, you can select them as "
"described in section :ref:`NonGlobalFeatureActivation` and select the screen"
" lock feature in the context menu. The screen lock can then be deactivated "
"either by selecting :guilabel:`Unlock` or switching back to "
":guilabel:`Monitoring` mode. The screen lock can also be activated globally "
"at first and later deactivated for individual computers via the context "
"menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to security restrictions of most operating systems, the lock screen can "
"not be displayed if no user is logged on. The input devices are still "
"locked, so that no user logon is possible."
msgstr "由于大多数操作系统的安全性限制，如果没有用户登录，则无法显示锁定屏幕。 输入设备仍处于锁定状态，因此无法进行用户登录。"

msgid "Remote access"
msgstr "远程访问"

msgid ""
"The feature group *remote access* consists of two very similar features "
":guilabel:`Remote view` and :guilabel:`Remote control`. In both access "
"modes, the screen of a remote computer is displayed in full size in a "
"separate window. In contrast to the monitoring mode in the main window, you "
"can watch the activities on a computer in detail or intervene yourself."
msgstr ""
"菜单栏*远程访问*中，由:guilabel:`远程浏览`和:guilabel:`远程控制`两部分组成。在两种模式下，远程计算机的屏幕都会在独立的窗口中显示。与主窗口中的控制模式不同，您可以清除看到远程计算机上的活动或是介入其中。"

msgid ""
"The features can be activated in different ways. Depending on the system "
"configuration, one of the two features is usually started by double-clicking"
" on a computer. Alternatively, you can click the right mouse button to open "
"the context menu and select the desired feature."
msgstr ""
"可以通过不同方式激活功能。 根据系统配置，通常通过双击计算机来启动两个功能之一。 或者，您可以单击鼠标右键以打开上下文菜单并选择所需的功能。"

msgid ""
"If you want to access a computer that does not appear in the monitor view, "
"use the corresponding toolbar button:"
msgstr "如果要访问未出现在监视器视图中的计算机，请使用相应的工具栏按钮:"

msgid ""
"After pressing this button, a dialog is opened and asks for the hostname of "
"the computer to access:"
msgstr "按下此按钮后，将打开一个对话框，询问要访问的计算机的主机名:"

msgid "Afterwards a new window opens with the remote access view:"
msgstr "然后一个带有远程访问视图的新窗口将会打开："

msgid ""
"The remote screen is then displayed within a few seconds and updated in real"
" time. At the top of the window you will see a toolbar with buttons similar "
"to the main application. The toolbar disappears automatically a few seconds "
"after the connection is established. You can show it again at any time by "
"moving the mouse pointer to the top of the screen."
msgstr ""
"然后在几秒钟内显示远程屏幕并实时更新。 在窗口顶部，您将看到一个工具栏，其按钮类似于主应用程序。 建立连接后，工具栏会自动消失几秒钟。 "
"您可以随时通过将鼠标指针移到屏幕顶部来再次显示它。"

msgid ""
"You can also change the access mode at any time during a running remote "
"access session. All you need to do is click on the :guilabel:`Remote "
"control` or :guilabel:`View only` button. The button does not show the "
"current access mode, but the access mode that is changed when pressed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As soon as you have entered the :guilabel:`Remote control` mode, your "
"keystrokes, mouse movements and clicks are transmitted to the remote "
"computer so that you can operate it as usual. However, depending on the "
"operating system, certain special keys or key shortcuts such as "
":kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+Del` cannot be used directly. If you want to use these "
"shortcuts, you can use the button :guilabel:`Send shortcut`.  Clicking this "
"button opens a menu where you can select the desired shortcut:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the menu was opened accidentally, it can also be closed again without "
"triggering an action by clicking the button again or pressing the :kbd:`Esc`"
" key."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to switch to fullscreen mode, you can use the "
":guilabel:`Fullscreen` button. In full screen mode, the button label changes"
" to :guilabel:`Window`. You can easily switch back to window mode by "
"clicking on it again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Screenshot` function captures the current screen content and "
"saves it to a file that can be displayed later. More information regarding "
"screenshots can be found in sections :ref:`Screenshots panel "
"<ScreenshotsPanel>` and :ref:`Screenshots <FeatureScreenshot>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "With the button :guilabel:`Exit` the remote access window is closed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Power on, restart and shutdown computers"
msgstr "打开、重新启动及关闭计算机"

msgid ""
"The features :guilabel:`Power on`, :guilabel:`Reboot` and :guilabel:`Power "
"down` are helpful both for administrative purposes and for the preparation "
"and follow-up of courses and exams. Using these functions, you can remotely "
"power on, restart, or shut down computers. The corresponding buttons can be "
"found in the toolbar:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the appropriate button to power on, restart, or shut down all "
"displayed computers. If you want to use a feature for individual computers "
"only, you can select the respective computers and select the desired item in"
